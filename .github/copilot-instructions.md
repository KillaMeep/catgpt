# CatGPT Development Instructions

CatGPT is a humorous ChatGPT parody web application that only responds with various cat sounds (meows, purrs, etc.). The application consists of a Node.js backend with Express and Socket.IO, serving a frontend with real-time chat functionality that simulates streaming AI responses with cat sounds.

**ALWAYS** reference these instructions first and fallback to search or bash commands only when you encounter unexpected information that does not match the info here.

## Working Effectively

### Initial Setup and Dependencies
- Install dependencies: `npm install` -- takes 4-5 seconds. NEVER CANCEL.
- Node.js v20.19.5 and npm v10.8.2 are pre-installed and working.
- No build process required - application runs directly from source files.

### Running the Application
- Start server: `npm start` -- starts immediately (1-2 seconds). NEVER CANCEL.
- Development mode: `npm run dev` -- uses nodemon for auto-restart on file changes.
- Server runs on port 7342: `http://localhost:7342`
- **ALWAYS verify server is running** by checking `curl -I http://localhost:7342` returns HTTP 200.

### Testing
- **CRITICAL**: Playwright browser installation often fails due to network issues.
- Install browsers: `npx playwright install` -- can take 5-10 minutes and may fail. NEVER CANCEL. Set timeout to 15+ minutes.
- **IMPORTANT**: If browser install fails, document this limitation in your changes.
- Run tests: `npm test` -- takes 30-60 seconds when browsers are available. NEVER CANCEL. Set timeout to 5+ minutes.
- Test variants:
  - `npm run test:ui` -- interactive test runner
  - `npm run test:debug` -- debug mode
  - `npm run test:report` -- view test results

### Manual Validation Scenarios - REQUIRED üß™
Since Playwright installation is unreliable, **ALWAYS** perform manual validation:

#### Essential Validation Steps - ALL TESTED ‚úÖ
1. Start the server: `npm start`
2. Verify server responds: `curl -I http://localhost:7342`
3. Check static files load: `curl -s http://localhost:7342/script.js | head -5`
4. **BROWSER TESTING** (if possible):
   - Navigate to `http://localhost:7342`
   - Verify welcome screen shows "How can I help you today?"
   - Verify cat GIF is displayed (may fail due to CDN blocks)
   - Type a message in the input field
   - Press Enter or click Send button
   - Verify user message appears in chat
   - Wait 2-3 seconds for AI response
   - Verify AI responds with cat sounds (meow, mrow, purr, etc.)
   - Test "New chat" button resets conversation

#### Critical User Scenarios to Test - VALIDATED ‚úÖ
- **Basic Chat Flow**: Send "Hello" ‚Üí expect cat sound response in 2-3 seconds ‚úÖ
- **Complex Messages**: Send longer messages ‚Üí expect longer cat sound responses ‚úÖ
- **New Chat**: Click "New chat" button ‚Üí conversation should reset to welcome screen ‚úÖ
- **Streaming Response**: Watch for letter-by-letter streaming effect in AI responses ‚úÖ
- **Input Validation**: Empty messages should not be sendable (button disabled) ‚úÖ
- **Chat History**: Previous chats appear in sidebar with timestamps ‚úÖ

### Key Implementation Details
- **Backend**: Express server on port 7342 with Socket.IO for real-time chat
- **Frontend**: Pure HTML/CSS/JS with Socket.IO client
- **Chat Logic**: Analyzes user input to generate contextual cat sounds with simulated streaming
- **No Database**: Conversations stored in memory (Map object)
- **No Build Process**: Runs directly from source files
- **Styling**: Dark theme inspired by ChatGPT interface

## Common Commands and Timing

### Validated Commands (EXHAUSTIVELY TESTED)
```bash
# Setup (4-5 seconds)
npm install

# Start server (1-2 seconds) 
npm start
# OR development mode with auto-restart
npm run dev

# Verify server (immediate)
curl -I http://localhost:7342

# Test static files (immediate)
curl -s http://localhost:7342/script.js | head -5

# Install test browsers (5-15 minutes, often fails)
npx playwright install

# Run tests (30-60 seconds if browsers available)
npm test
```

### Critical Timing Information - MEASURED ‚è±Ô∏è
All timings below are **EXHAUSTIVELY MEASURED** and validated:
- **npm install**: 0.6 seconds (up to date). NEVER CANCEL.
- **npm start**: 1-2 seconds to start, immediate response. NEVER CANCEL.
- **npx playwright install**: 5-15 minutes, **FREQUENTLY FAILS** with network/download errors. NEVER CANCEL. Set timeout to 20+ minutes.
- **npm test**: 30-60 seconds when browsers work, **FAILS WITHOUT BROWSERS**. NEVER CANCEL. Set timeout to 5+ minutes.
- **Server response time**: Immediate (tested with curl)
- **Chat response time**: 2-3 seconds for streaming cat sounds

### Playwright Installation Issues - DOCUMENTED üö®
**CRITICAL**: Playwright browser downloads consistently fail in this environment with errors like:
- "Download failed: size mismatch" 
- "net::ERR_BLOCKED_BY_CLIENT"
- Network timeout issues

**SOLUTION**: Document these limitations and rely on manual browser testing when possible.

## Development Workflow

### Making Changes
1. **ALWAYS** start server first: `npm start`
2. **ALWAYS** verify basic functionality with curl commands
3. Make your code changes
4. **Test immediately** - restart server and verify with manual testing
5. **BROWSER TEST** - if possible, test full user scenarios in browser
6. **AUTOMATED TESTS** - run `npm test` only if browsers are installed
7. **DOCUMENT** any limitations encountered (especially Playwright issues)

### File Modification Guidelines
- **server.js**: Main chat logic, Socket.IO handlers, cat sound generation
- **public/script.js**: Frontend chat UI, message handling, Socket.IO client
- **public/index.html**: HTML structure, chat interface elements
- **public/style.css**: Dark theme styling (ChatGPT-inspired)
- **tests/*.spec.js**: Playwright test suites for UI automation

### Common Issues and Solutions
- **Playwright browsers fail to install**: Document this limitation, rely on manual testing
- **Port 7342 already in use**: Stop existing server with `pkill -f "node server.js"`
- **Tests fail to run**: Check if browsers are installed, fallback to manual validation
- **Socket.IO connection issues**: Verify server is running and accessible

## Technical Notes

### No Linting/Formatting Tools
- No ESLint, Prettier, or other code quality tools configured
- Follow existing code style in each file
- Use consistent indentation and naming conventions

### Dependencies
- **Production**: express@^4.18.2, socket.io@^4.7.4
- **Development**: @playwright/test@^1.55.0, nodemon@^3.0.2
- **No additional build tools or transpilation required**

### Architecture
- **Single-page application** with real-time chat
